# SharedHistory Page Implementation

## Overview

The SharedHistory page (`/shared-history`) is a new component that displays the user's shared analysis history stored in Azure Table Storage and Blob Storage. It replaces the traditional local IndexedDB-based history page in the navigation while providing a link to access older local analyses.

## Key Features

### üîê Authentication Required
- Displays authentication prompt for non-authenticated users
- Only shows shared analyses for authenticated users
- Links to login/sign-in process

### üìä Shared Analysis Display
- Shows all analyses the user has shared to the cloud
- Real-time sync with Azure Table Storage via SharedHistoryService
- Each item displays as "shared" with cloud icon indicator
- Supports all analysis types (YouTube, GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, HackerNews, DevBlogs, Manual)

### üîç Search and Filtering
- **Search**: Real-time search through analysis content (title, summary, full analysis, user input)
- **Date Range Filter**: Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, All Time
- **Service Type Filter**: Filter by specific platforms (YouTube, GitHub, Reddit, etc.)
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically reloads results when search terms change

### üéõÔ∏è Analysis Management
- **View**: Click on any analysis item to navigate to full analysis viewer
- **Copy Analysis**: Copy analysis content to clipboard
- **Copy Share Link**: Copy shareable link to clipboard (all items are already shared)
- **Open Source Link**: Direct link to original content (except Manual analyses)
- **Delete**: Remove individual shared analysis from cloud storage (with confirmation)

### üì± Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized layout with collapsible action menus
- Responsive filtering interface
- Proper touch targets and spacing for mobile devices
- Consistent styling with light/dark theme support

### üóÑÔ∏è Local Archive Integration
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects if user has local IndexedDB history
- **Archive Link**: Shows "Local Analysis Archive" section at bottom when local history exists
- **Migration Path**: Provides clear path to access older local analyses during transition period

## Technical Implementation

### Service Integration
```csharp
@inject FeedbackWebApp.Services.ISharedHistoryServiceProvider SharedHistoryServiceProvider
```

The page uses the SharedHistoryService which:
- Supports both real and mock implementations via provider pattern
- Integrates with Azure Functions backend (GetUsersSavedAnalysis, DeleteSharedAnalysis)
- Provides caching for performance optimization
- Handles error scenarios gracefully

### Data Flow
1. **Load**: Retrieves SharedAnalysisEntity objects from SharedHistoryService
2. **Convert**: Transforms entities to AnalysisHistoryItem for UI compatibility
3. **Display**: Renders using existing HistoryHelper utilities for consistency
4. **Actions**: Delegates operations back to SharedHistoryService

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to empty lists on service errors
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Proper loading states and error messages

## Navigation Changes

The main navigation now points to `/shared-history` instead of `/history`:
- **Mobile Menu**: Updated dropdown with cloud upload icon
- **Desktop Menu**: Updated navigation link with cloud upload icon
- **Icon Change**: Changed from `bi-clock-history` to `bi-cloud-upload` to indicate cloud storage

## Backward Compatibility

- Old `/history` route remains functional for accessing local IndexedDB data
- "Local Analysis Archive" section appears when user has local data
- Smooth transition path for users migrating from local to shared storage
- Existing HistoryHelper methods work with both local and shared data

## Styling

Custom CSS (`SharedHistory.razor.css`) provides:
- Consistent theming with existing application design
- Shared item indicators with green accent borders
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Dark/light theme support
- Animation effects for better user experience

## Usage

Users can now:
1. **Navigate** to "Saved" in the main menu to view shared analyses
2. **Search** through their shared analysis collection
3. **Filter** by date range and service type
4. **Click** on any analysis item to view the full analysis in the SharedAnalysisViewer
5. **Manage** individual shared analyses (copy, copy link, delete)
6. **Access** older local analyses via the "Local Analysis Archive" link when available

### Analysis Interaction
- **Analysis Preview**: Each item shows a summary preview with fade-out effect
- **Click to View**: Click anywhere on the analysis content area to navigate to full analysis
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects indicate clickable areas with smooth transitions
- **No Sharing Required**: All items are already shared, so only "Copy Link" actions are available

This implementation provides a seamless transition from local storage to cloud-based shared analysis management while maintaining full backward compatibility and providing an intuitive click-to-view interface.
